# Outputs_Training
Example code for creating web apps or html outputs using streamlit and quarto. This content is based on content from the [HSMA Programme](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/).

# Try out the code
In order to run the code you will need to download a copy of this repo and see requirements in each section. Do this by clicking the big green 'Code' button top right and selecting 'Download ZIP' then unpack the files somewhere sensible on your computer, I would recommend somewhere on the C Drive rather than a shared drive.

## HTML
### Requirements: Install Live Server extension from VSCode
HTML files act as blueprints that tell web browsers (like Edge & Chrome) how to display text, images, links and other elements. Every page you are viewing in a browser (including this one!) has an underlying .html file that the browser is interpreting. If you want to see the HTML for a web page, right click this page and select 'Inspect'. 
* The HTML folder in this repo contains a single file index.html if you open it in VSCode you will see some example html (generated by ChatGPT)
* If you open this file in file explorer it should open in your default browser and show you a very unexciting looking web page (if you are too young to remember, this is what every webpage used to look like in the 90s, if you don't beleive me have a look [here](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/web-design-in-the-90s)) :space_invader:
* If you had crafted an .html file that you wanted to share with stakeholders there are 3 different ways you could share it.
      * You could email it out them them just like any other file and they could open it in their browser
      * You could host it on the local network and anyone on the local network could visit it (like we do with SSRS reports) - try this using the Live Server extension for VSCode
      * You could host it on the web, for which you would need to install a web server or host the page on an external server
